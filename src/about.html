                <h1>My Journey</h1>
                <p>I’m Mujavid, the co-founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://scoodle.co.uk/">Scoodle</a>, a platform connecting students with educators. Education is extremely important to me, because it was my teachers and mentors who changed my life.</p>
                <figure>

                <p>One of the challenges of coming from a low socio-economic background and going to an underperforming school is not realising what you are capable of. I would often hear inspirational stories about people, like Steve Jobs, who had come from tough backgrounds but achieved great success. I would always ask myself, if they could do it, then why can't I? I had big dreams for myself, but whenever I told my friends and classmates they would put me down. Not to mention, my teachers would juggle their time between teaching and trying to keep teens away from crime. For a long time I was convinced that due to my background I would not amount to anything.</p>
                <p>However, a few teachers saw something in me. They believed in me and they invested in me after school and during their breaks. They made me believe in myself.</p>

                <p>Fast forward to every teenager’s most nail-biting milestones, I found that I began to ace my exams and managed to get into one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013">top 5</a> universities in the world, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL (University College London)</a>. I later went on to work for Google, where I broke an internal record with the fastest interview to hire process. At Google, I built products to help teams at Youtube, Gmail and Google Docs. Even at Google, I continued my education by finding mentors to help guide me. I finally began to realise those aspirations that looked like mere dreams of an inner-city kid. The same dreams I nearly gave up on as a teenager, were now happening in front of me.</p>

                    <figcaption>Life at Google wasn't all free food and quirky benefits. There was a lot of hard work.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Over time, my passion for education has continued to grow. Throughout my uni studies and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mujavid/">working history</a>, I worked part time at supplementary schools for over five years to help others who came from the same background as me. I even worked at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to help bring Computer Science education to over 100,000 students across the country.</p>
                <p>During university, I realised that many students didn't have the right advice when making pivotal decisions concerning their university degrees. I founded RateMyModules, a website that helped uni students make informed decisions about their education.</p>

                <p>My experiences with amazing teachers changed my life and I want to help others do the same. I founded Scoodle to help students find great teachers. Students ask questions on our platform, we take those questions and give them to the most qualified teachers to answer. Over 97% of questions have been answered, and those answers have over 20,000 views. We have helped students from over 180 different schools across the UK get help with their education. We have gone from strength to strength and recently made it into <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/oxfoundry/status/973210761265893376">Oxford University’s Startup Accelerator</a>, opened <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-41582715">by Tim Cook</a>.</p>
                <p>I want students to know that there is no glass ceiling. No matter where they come from or what they do, there is no limit to what they can achieve.</p>
                <p>Everyone has something they want to learn and everyone has something they can teach. I want to bring both sides together so that everyone can grow and learn to achieve their best.</p>
                <p>Learning is for life.</p>
                <p>Peace out,<br />Mujavid</p>
